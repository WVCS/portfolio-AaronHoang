<p>  Backstroke: For the start, you want to push off the wall with your legs as hard as possible and arch your back as you dive into the water hands first.  You want your backstroke start to be as smooth as possible.  And you want to do as many dolphin kicks until you feel like you are slowing down.  After, you do not want to do fast strokes, go medium speed and remember to kick as hard as you can.  Keep your arms straight, and try to get the most distance per stroke. </p>
