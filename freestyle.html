<p> After you jump off the block, you would want to do as many under water dolphin kicks as possible until you feel like you are slowing down, then, you would want to keep your head under water and do 2-3 strokes and then breathe, keep this up for the whole race and you will end up with a solid time!  Now, for form, you want to keep your arms relatively straight throughout the whole stroke, except for when your arms are out of the water, you want to have a slight bend in your arm.  During the stroke, you want to try not to move your arms side to side, you want them in a flat perfect circle, never cross you arm accross your body. </p>
