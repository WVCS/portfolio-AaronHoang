<p>  Butterfly: for butterfly, yu want to jump off of the block as far as you can, then do as many underwater dolphin kicks until you feel like you are slowing down.  Make sure you are in streamline position, then pull down on the water with your arms and then you want your arms to fly out of the water and then finish the full stroke with two dolphin kicks.  Bonus tip: Before your arms fly out of the water, when you pull down on the water, make sure the shape that you make when you pull down looks like a lightbulb. </p>
