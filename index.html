<h3> Freestyle: After you jump off the block, you would want to do as many under water dolphin kicks as possible until you feel like you are slowing down, then, you would want to keep your head under water and do 2-3 strokes and then breathe, keep this up for the whole race and you will end up with a solid time!  Now, for form, you want to keep your arms relatively straight throughout the whole stroke, except for when your arms are out of the water, you want to have a slight bend in your arm.  During the stroke, you want to try not to move your arms side to side, you want them in a flat perfect circle, never cross you arm accross your body.</h3>

<h4> Backstroke: For the start, you want to push off the wall with your legs as hard as possible and arch your back as you dive into the water hands first.  You want your backstroke start to be as smooth as possible.  And you want to do as many dolphin kicks until you feel like you are slowing down.  After, you do not want to do fast strokes, go medium speed and remember to kick as hard as you can.  Keep your arms straight, and try to get the most distance per stroke.
